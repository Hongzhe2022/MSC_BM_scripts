# MSC_BM_scripts

Here we present the scripts used to process the MSC_BM data published on the [NCBI GEO GSE190965](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE190965) as well as [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/).

The data has been processed in three steps:
1. [Combining the loom files](./scripts/Hongze_healthy_2020_10_merged.html) created during mapping of the data using kallist/bustools filtering and normalization
2. [2D UMAP, clustering and downstream analysis](./scripts/Hongze_healthy_2020_10_merged_2D.html).
